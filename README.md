# Ladder-Shaped Water Filtration System for Lemon Irrigation

## Overview
This innovative ladder-shaped water filtration system is engineered to deliver clean, safe water suitable for agricultural use, specifically for irrigating lemon plants. The system employs a multi-stage filtration process to efficiently remove large particles, salts, and heavy metals from raw water sources, ensuring optimal water quality for sensitive crops.

## System Components

- **Water Reservoir (Bottle):** Initial container holding raw water.
- **Stage 1 - Sedimentation Box:** Utilizes gravels, activated carbon, and silica gel to settle and filter out large particles and sediments through gravity.
- **Stage 2 - Reverse Osmosis (RO) Box:** Employs an RO membrane to remove dissolved salts and other dissolved contaminants.
- **Stage 3 - Electrocoagulation Box:** Applies electrocoagulation to eliminate heavy metals and fine suspended solids.
- **Pumps:**
  - **Pump 1:** Controls water inflow to the sedimentation stage via a valve.
  - **Pump 2:** Transfers water from the sedimentation stage to the RO membrane.
  - **Pump 3:** Circulates water from the electrocoagulation stage back to the upper box for recirculation or further treatment.
- **Valves:** Regulate and control water flow between the stages.

## How It Works

1. Raw water enters the system from the reservoir bottle.
2. Pump 1 regulates water flow into the sedimentation stage where large particles and sediments settle out.
3. Pump 2 moves partially filtered water to the RO membrane to remove dissolved salts and impurities.
4. Pump 3 pumps water from the electrocoagulation unit back to the upper stages for recirculation, enhancing purification efficiency.
5. The treated water, free from salts, heavy metals, and sediments, is then suitable for irrigating lemon trees, promoting healthier growth and better yield.
